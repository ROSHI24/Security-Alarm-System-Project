Security Alarm System :
A low-cost, customizable home security solution designed to detect intrusions within a specific range and provide real-time audible feedback.

Project Overview:
This project was developed as an academic mini-project to demonstrate the practical application of sensors. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to monitor space and triggers an alarm if a threshold is breached.

How It Works:
Intrusion Detection:An HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of objects in its field of view.
Logic Processing:The Arduino Uno calculates the distance. If an object is detected within ≈2 meters, it flags an intrusion.
Feedback System:Audible:A Piezo buzzer sounds the alarm.
Visual:** A 16x2 LCD displays the current status

Components Used:
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
Sensors: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Output:16x2 LCD Display, Piezo Buzzer, 4 LEDs
Prototyping: Breadboard and Jumper Wires

Key Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous distance calculation with high accuracy.
User Interface: Live status updates on the LCD screen.
Customizable Thresholds: Detection range can be easily modified in the code.
Affordable Design: Built entirely using budget-friendly, off-the-shelf components.

Developed collaboratively as part of an academic mini-project.
